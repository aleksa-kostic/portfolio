# UCI Data Science Capstone Project 2022:
## How the League of Legends Subreddit Can Predict In-Game Trends
#### In collaboration with Baolong Le Truong (baolonlt@uci.edu) and Mohammad Kanawati (mkanawat@uci.edu)

**Attention**: if you wish to see the files, I recommend looking at the PDF files only. They are the jupyter notebooks exported to PDF. Though, if you would like to open the jupyter notebook on your device, you're welcome to do so.

These files are the state of our project as of April 6, 2022. 

So far, we've gathered data using two APIs (Riot Games and Reddit), and have cleaned the data and begun text featurization to be utilized in binary classification.
This repository contains work that I have produced in gathering Reddit submission and comment data from the League of Legends subreddit, and in cleaning the data and creating Word2Vec models to be used in our next step.

Our next step is to create a binary classification model using machine learning techniques. After this, we'll evaluate our models, improve upon them, and give our final report. 
Additionally, we will use AWS to create a cloud-based postgreSQL database to store our data as it is currently nearing a couple gigabytes in memory.
