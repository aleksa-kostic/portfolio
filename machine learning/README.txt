To know more about my ongoing machine learning projects, please inquire are my email at 
akostic@uci.edu or akostic1@outlook.com. I'm currently taking a neural networks and 
deep learning course in which I will be building a project by the end of May, and I'm 
working on a project for my datascience capstone class in which I'm implementing a 
word2vec model, which requires neural networks, and will soon be creating a binary 
classification model with the use of machine learning.

Included are homework assignment projects I performed in spring quarter of 2021. Concepts
include clustering and eigenfaces, logistic regression, shattering, VC components, clustering,
logistic regression. The course was CS 178 taught by professor Stephen Mandt and UCI. 

As of the beginning of April, I will be working on neural networks and other deep learning
projects. If you're seeing this after the start of April 2022 and would like to inquire
about my works, please contact me at akostic1@outlook.com or akostic@uci.edu.
