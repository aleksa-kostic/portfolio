[**Capstone**](https://github.com/aleksa-kostic/portfolio/tree/main/Capstone):
> Contains the my data science capstone project (ended May 31, 2022). This will be updated weekly. Contains PDFs of the final report, jupyter notebooks, CSV files, Word2Vec model files, and figure PNGs

**Bayesian Statistics**:
> Short report examples utilizing bayesian statistical methods

**Information Retrieval**:
> Project in search engine building utilizing BeautifulSoup, SQLAlchemy, and postgreSQL

**Machine Learning**:
> Simple examples using multiple ML techniques

**SQL**:
> Files 'queries.sql' and 'setup.sql' contain a sample of SQL used in data analysis for an assignment. However, a few projects such as in the ```Information Retrieval``` directory also utilize SQL (see ```searchengineandquerying``` within the aforementioned directory)
> 
> For more SQL-like examples, please check visualizations to see use of SQL-like commands to group, select, and aggregate data

**Visualizations**:
> A couple small visualization projects using Seaborn, and using SQL-like functions via Pandas
